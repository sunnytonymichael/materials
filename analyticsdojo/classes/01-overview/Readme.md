## Technology Fundamentals - Class 1 Recap
All, as I mentioned office hours will be this Friday from 9:30-12:00 rather than Thursday. I'll plan on presenting the same thing I did with Microsoft Azure in the SA lounge at 10. 

Given the size of the class, I'll plan on having all examples I do in class run on the Microsoft Azure Studio. This cloud based environment will be easier for beginners to navigate. Docker works well and I'm glad to help you get it setup, but please follow the detailed setup procedure and videos on [rpi.analyticsdojo.com](http://rpi.analyticsdojo.com) prior to the office hours.

Don't get stuck on the Docker container.  I'll be continuing to update the details for the install procedure [here](https://github.com/AnalyticsDojo/materials/blob/master/README.md) as issues come up. If you work through an issue with getting it setup on a PC, please share that with the class. 

Hopefully you got even more excited about analytics during class.  By next class you should be familar with what a Jupyter notebook is and how to access data.  

Here are some useful links.  
- [Course Website](https://jkuruzovich.github.io/tech-fundamentals-analytics/) has all assignments
- [Syllabus, Presentations, Notebooks, Docker Container for Data Science](https://github.com/AnalyticsDojo/materials) are located in the /AnalyticsDojo/Materials repository.
- [RPI LMS (Blackboard)](https://lms9.rpi.edu) should be used to submit all assignments. 
- [Piazza](http://piazza.com/rpi/fall2016/mgmt6963) should be used for problems with course assignment and communications with instructor.
- [rpi.analyticsdojo.com](http://rpi.analyticsdojo.com) will be used for much of the content etc. 
- [Microsoft Azure Machine Learning](https://studio.azureml.net) is an easy way of working with Jupyter Notebooks.
